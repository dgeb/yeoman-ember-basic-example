# Yeoman / Ember Basic Example

A very primitive example of an Ember.js app managed by Yeoman.

## Getting started

Install required plugin:

```
$ npm install grunt-ember-templates
```

Fire up the server (it will compile the templates as first task):

```
$ grunt server
```

## Next steps

I'd like to add dependency management with minispade.

I'd also like to extract some of the patterns from this example into yeoman generators.
